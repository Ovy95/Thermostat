# Thermostat

## Makers Week 5 Javascript project
Purpose of the project was to build the logic needed to model a simple thermostat. This is a web app made with Javascript & Jquery. When the webapp is run it also calls on a Open Weather API to show the current temperature in London by default. There is a search box which allows you to enter in a city which will update the temperature to that current temperature. 

## Specification:

- [x] Thermostat starts at 20 degrees
- [x] You can increase the temperature with an up function
- [x] You can decrease the temperature with a down function
- [x] The minimum temperature is 10 degrees
- [x] If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees
- [x] If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees
- [x] Power saving mode is on by default
- [x] You can reset the temperature to 20 with a reset function
- [x] You can ask about the thermostat's current energy usage: < 18 is low-usage, < 25 is medium-usage, anything else is high-usage.
- [x] (In the challenges where we add an interface, low-usage will be indicated with green, medium-usage indicated with black, high-usage indicated with red.)
